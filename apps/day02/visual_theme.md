### Theme
- Setting: North Pole gift shop checkout counter scanning product IDs.
- Mood: playful retail tech — receipt tape, barcode glow, candy-cane accent.
- Palette (hex): background `#0f0c0a`, receipt paper `#fdf7ed`, accent red `#e63946`, mint `#5be7c4`, gold `#f6c344`, shadow ink `#2d2a32`.
- Typography vibe: condensed monospace for digits (receipt-like), soft sans for labels.

### Metaphor
- Conveyor of product tags (IDs) sliding under a scanner beam.
- Each ID appears as a receipt strip of boxed digits; repeating chunks are highlighted as alternating bands to show duplication.
- A running till display shows the cumulative invalid-ID sum like a register total.
- Progress through each range is a thin bar moving along a shelf marker beneath the conveyor.

### How theme guides rendering
- Dark shop backdrop with a subtle vignette; bright paper strips pop against it.
- Scanner beam drawn as a horizontal mint-to-red gradient passing over the active ID; successful repeats pulse gold.
- Alternating chunk fills (red/mint) visually encode the repeated segment count.
- The register total sits in the upper-right, glowing gold when updated.
- Range labels and progress bars use muted ink colors to keep focus on the digits and beam.
